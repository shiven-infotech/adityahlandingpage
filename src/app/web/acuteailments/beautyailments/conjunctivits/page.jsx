          <p>
            Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is a common eye problem that causes
            redness and swelling in the clear tissue covering the white part of your eye and
            lining the inner eyelids (called the conjunctiva). It can happen because of
            infections, allergies, irritants like smoke or chemicals, or viruses like those
            causing the common cold.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            When you have conjunctivitis, your eyes may look red or pink, feel itchy or
            gritty, produce a watery or thick discharge, and sometimes cause blurry vision.
            It can affect one or both eyes and can spread easily, especially if it's due to
            bacteria or viruses.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Treating conjunctivitis depends on what caused it. Homeopathy offers a natural
            way to deal with this condition using gentle remedies customized to your
            specific symptoms and overall health. These remedies are designed to ease
            inflammation, relieve discomfort, and help your eyes heal without causing any
            harsh side effects.
