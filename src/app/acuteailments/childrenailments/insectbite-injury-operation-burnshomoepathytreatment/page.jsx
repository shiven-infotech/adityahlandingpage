          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Insect bites, injuries, operations, and burns are common types of
            physical traumas that people may experience.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Insect bites can cause itching, redness, and swelling, often from
            mosquitoes, bees, or spiders. Injuries range from cuts and bruises
            to sprains and fractures, causing pain and discomfort. Operations
            involve surgical procedures for various medical reasons, requiring
            post-operative care. Burns result from exposure to heat, chemicals,
            or electricity, leading to skin damage and pain.

    Causes of Insect Bite, Injury, Operation & Burns
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
    The causes behind insect bites, injuries, surgical complications, and burns
    are varied but often related to external triggers or unavoidable situations.
    Insect bites occur when mosquitoes, bees, spiders, or other insects inject
    saliva, venom, or irritants into the skin, leading to allergic or toxic
    reactions. Injuries can arise from accidental falls, sports activities,
    workplace hazards, or household mishaps, causing cuts, bruises, or sprains.
    Surgical operations, though medically necessary, may result in post-operative
    pain, infections, delayed wound healing, or scar formation due to tissue
    trauma and immune response. Burns are commonly caused by contact with heat,
    flames, chemicals, electricity, or hot liquids, with severity depending on
    depth and extent of skin damage. Psychological and environmental factors, such
    as carelessness, lack of safety measures, or stress-related inattention, can
    further increase the risk of these conditions. Understanding these causes
    allows for both prevention and timely management, while homoeopathy helps
    address the after-effects in a safe, holistic manner.

    Signs and Symptoms of Insect Bite, Injury, Operation & Burns
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
    The signs and symptoms of insect bites, injuries, surgical operations, and
    burns can vary depending on the severity and nature of the condition. Insect
    bites typically present with redness, itching, localized swelling, rashes, or
    sometimes allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing or widespread hives.
    Injuries may cause sharp or throbbing pain, bruising, swelling, cuts, or loss
    of movement in the affected area. Post-operative symptoms often include pain
    at the surgical site, tenderness, stiffness, delayed healing, or scar tissue
    formation, along with fatigue or emotional distress from the procedure. Burns
    usually present with intense pain, redness, blisters, swelling, or peeling of
    skin, and in severe cases, deeper tissue damage, infection, and scarring.
    Emotional signs such as fear, irritability, or restlessness may also accompany
    these physical conditions. Recognizing these symptoms early is important for
    timely care and to prevent complications, while homoeopathic treatment helps
    in managing discomfort and supporting natural recovery.
