            What is Mental Stress in Adults?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Mental stress in adults refers to the emotional strain or pressure
            that arises from various aspects of life such as work,
            relationships, financial challenges, or personal responsibilities.
            It’s that feeling of being overwhelmed, anxious, or tense due to the
            demands and expectations we face daily. This kind of stress can
            affect our mood, sleep, and overall well-being. It is important to
            recognize and manage mental stress because it can also impact our
            physical health. Finding ways to cope, such as through relaxation
            techniques or seeking support, can greatly help in navigating and
            reducing stress levels.

    Causes of Mental Stress in Adults
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Mental stress in adults can arise from several different situations and
    challenges in life. One of the most common causes is <span className="font-semibold">work pressure
    and career challenges</span>, where excessive workload, tight deadlines, or job
    insecurity often create constant mental strain.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    <span className="font-semibold">Financial strain</span> is another frequent contributor, as difficulties
    with debts, bills, or managing family expenses can lead to ongoing emotional
    tension and worry. Similarly, <span className="font-semibold">relationship conflicts</span>, including
    marital problems, family disputes, or social misunderstandings, can heavily
    affect one’s peace of mind.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    <span className="font-semibold">Health concerns</span>, whether due to chronic illness, sudden medical
    conditions, or the responsibility of caregiving, also add to stress levels.
    In addition, <span className="font-semibold">life transitions</span> such as relocating, changing jobs,
    or coping with the loss of a loved one can cause significant emotional
    instability.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Unrealistic <span className="font-semibold">high expectations</span> placed by oneself or by society
    may lead to frustration and anxiety, while a poor <span className="font-semibold">work-life
    balance</span> with limited relaxation, lack of proper sleep, and excessive
    responsibilities often results in persistent mental stress.

    Signs and Symptoms of Mental Stress in Adults
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">

    and behavioral changes. One of the earliest signs is <span className="font-semibold">

    irritability, mood swings,</span> and difficulty in controlling emotions.

    insomnia, restless nights, or excessive sleep. Along with this, <span className="font-semibold">
    fatigue and low energy</span> are common, making daily tasks feel more
    challenging. Headaches, muscle tension, and digestive issues are also
    frequent physical manifestations of stress.

    poor concentration, forgetfulness,</span> and difficulty in making decisions.
    Over time, these symptoms may affect job performance, relationships, and
    overall quality of life.

  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
