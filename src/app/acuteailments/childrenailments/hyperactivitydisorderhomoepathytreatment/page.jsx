          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Hyperactivity Disorder, also known as Attention Deficit
            Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is a condition that affects both
            children and adults, causing difficulties with attention,
            impulsivity, and hyperactivity. People with ADHD may struggle to
            focus on tasks, have trouble sitting still, and act impulsively
            without thinking through consequences. It can impact various aspects
            of life, including school or work performance and social
            interactions. However, with proper diagnosis and management,
            individuals with ADHD can learn strategies to cope with their
            symptoms and lead fulfilling lives. Treatment options such as
            therapy, lifestyle changes, and sometimes medications like those in
            homeopathy can help manage ADHD symptoms effectively.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <strong className="text-green-700">Holistic Approach:</strong> Homeopathy looks at the whole
            person, considering not just the symptoms but also their overall
            health, emotions, and lifestyle. By addressing these aspects
            together, homeopathy aims to provide a more complete and thorough
            treatment experience for individuals with Hyperactivity Disorder.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
            <strong className="text-green-700">Non-Invasive:</strong> Homeopathic remedies are made from
            natural substances and are gentle on the body. Unlike some
            medications that may have strong effects or side effects, homeopathy
            offers a safe and non-invasive option for managing Hyperactivity
            Disorder symptoms.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
            <strong className="text-green-700">Personalized Treatment:</strong> Each person's experience
            with Hyperactivity Disorder is unique, with varying symptoms and
            triggers. Homeopathy acknowledges this diversity by creating
            personalized treatment plans that take into account specific
            symptoms, emotional states, and individual needs. This personalized
            approach increases the likelihood of positive outcomes.

            <strong className="text-green-700">Promotes Calmness:</strong> One of the primary goals of
            homeopathy in treating Hyperactivity Disorder is to reduce
            hyperactivity and impulsivity while promoting a sense of calmness
            and improved focus. By addressing the root causes and rebalancing
            the body's natural systems, homeopathy can help individuals
            experience greater peace and concentration in their daily lives.

      {/* Causes Section */}
<section className="" data-aos="fade-up">
  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-4">
    Causes of Hyperactivity Disorder in Children
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Hyperactivity disorder in children usually develops due to a mix of
    biological, psychological, and environmental factors. One of the leading
    contributors is <span className="font-semibold">genetic predisposition</span>. Children with a
    family history of ADHD or behavioral disorders are at a higher risk of
    developing hyperactive symptoms.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    <span className="font-semibold">Brain development and neurochemical
    imbalances</span> are also important causes. Differences in the areas of the
    brain responsible for attention, impulse control, and activity regulation,
    as well as irregularities in neurotransmitters like dopamine, can lead to
    hyperactivity.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Early life factors such as <span className="font-semibold">premature birth, low birth weight,
    or prenatal exposure</span> to toxins, alcohol, or maternal stress during
    pregnancy can increase the likelihood of hyperactive behavior in children.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Environmental triggers also play a significant role. <span className="font-semibold">
    Chaotic home environments, high stress levels, lack of structured routines,
    and poor sleep patterns</span> may worsen symptoms of hyperactivity.
    Additionally, excessive screen time, overstimulation, or poor dietary
    habits can make children more restless and impulsive.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    It is important to note that hyperactivity disorder is not caused by a
    single factor but rather a <span className="font-semibold">combination of genetics, brain
    function, lifestyle, and environment</span>, all of which contribute to the
    childâ€™s behavior and ability to regulate activity levels.

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-4">
    Signs and Symptoms of Hyperactivity Disorder in Children
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Children with hyperactivity disorder often show <span className="font-semibold">
    excessive restlessness and constant movement</span>. They may have difficulty
    sitting still, frequently fidget, or feel the urge to run and climb even in
    situations where it is not appropriate.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    A common symptom is <span className="font-semibold">impulsivity</span>, where children act without
    thinking about the consequences. This can be seen in behaviors like
    interrupting conversations, blurting out answers, grabbing things suddenly,
    or having trouble waiting for their turn.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Many children also struggle with <span className="font-semibold">short attention span and
    distractibility</span>. They often find it hard to focus on tasks, complete
    schoolwork, or follow instructions, leading to <span className="font-semibold">
    frequent mistakes and unfinished activities</span>.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Emotional signs may include <span className="font-semibold">irritability, frustration, and
    frequent mood swings</span>. These children may get upset easily, find it
    difficult to manage their emotions, and sometimes overreact to minor issues.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
    Over time, these symptoms can affect <span className="font-semibold">
    academic performance, social relationships, and self-confidence</span>,
    making it essential to recognize the signs early and provide supportive care.
