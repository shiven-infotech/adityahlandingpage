            <strong>What is Lumbar Spondylosis?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            Lumbar spondylosis is a condition that affects your lower back,
            specifically the part of your spine called the lumbar region. It
            happens as you get older and your spinal discs and bones start to
            wear down, causing changes in your spine.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            This condition can also be caused by things like having poor
            posture, being overweight, or having had injuries in the past. When
            you have lumbar spondylosis, you might feel pain, stiffness, or
            find it harder to move your lower back. Sometimes, the pain can
            travel down your legs, which is known as sciatica.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            To manage lumbar spondylosis, you can try different things. Pain
            relief options like medications can help with the discomfort. Doing
            physical therapy and specific exercises can make your back muscles
            stronger and improve how well you can move. Changing your lifestyle
            by keeping a healthy weight, sitting and standing properly, and
            using supportive tools can also make a difference.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            It's important to talk to a healthcare provider so they can
            understand your symptoms and create a plan that fits your needs.
            With the right care, people with lumbar spondylosis can feel better
            and keep their spine healthy.

    Causes of Lumbar Spondylosis
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Lumbar spondylosis refers to **age-related degeneration of the lower back (lumbar spine)**. 
      It is a common condition that develops gradually due to wear and tear of spinal discs, 
      bones, and joints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary cause is **degenerative disc changes**. As people age, spinal discs lose 
      water content and elasticity, reducing their ability to cushion the vertebrae, which 
      results in friction and stiffness.
    </p>
    <p>
      **Bone spurs (osteophytes)** may form as a compensatory mechanism, leading to nerve 
      compression and back pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risk factors such as **poor posture, prolonged sitting, heavy lifting, or obesity** 
      accelerate the degeneration process in the lumbar spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous **back injuries, repetitive strain, genetic predisposition, and sedentary 
      lifestyle** also contribute significantly to lumbar spondylosis.

    Signs and Symptoms of Lumbar Spondylosis
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The most common symptom is **chronic lower back pain and stiffness**, which 
      may worsen after sitting, standing for long periods, or physical exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pain may **radiate to the buttocks, thighs, or legs (sciatica-like symptoms)** 
      if spinal nerves are compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many patients experience **numbness, tingling, or weakness** in the lower limbs 
      due to nerve root involvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      **Reduced flexibility and limited range of motion** in the lower back make 
      bending or twisting movements difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Severe cases can present with **difficulty walking, poor balance, or bladder 
      and bowel dysfunction**, which indicates spinal cord compression and requires 
      urgent attention.
