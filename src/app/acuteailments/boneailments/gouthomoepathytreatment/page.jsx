            <strong>What is Gout?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Gout is like a type of arthritis that often targets the joints,
            especially in the big toe. It happens because tiny crystals of uric
            acid build up in these joints, causing a sudden and intense kind of
            pain, along with swelling, redness, and warmth in that area.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This problem can arise if your body makes too much uric acid or if
            it doesn't get rid of it properly. Eating certain foods like red
            meat, seafood, alcohol, and sugary drinks can raise uric acid levels
            and trigger these painful gout episodes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Dealing with gout can be tough as it can really disrupt your daily
            life. Treatment usually involves taking medicines to ease the pain
            and reduce swelling when these painful attacks happen. Making some
            lifestyle changes can also help a lot, such as eating a healthy
            diet, drinking plenty of water, cutting back on alcohol, and keeping
            your weight in check. These steps can not only prevent gout attacks
            but also manage the condition over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you suspect you might have gout or experience sudden joint pain
            and swelling, it's super important to see a doctor. They can figure
            out if it's indeed gout and then suggest the best ways to treat it
            and keep it under control.
