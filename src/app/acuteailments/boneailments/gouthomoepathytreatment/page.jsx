            <strong>What is Gout?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            Gout is like a type of arthritis that often targets the joints,
            especially in the big toe. It happens because tiny crystals of uric
            acid build up in these joints, causing a sudden and intense kind of
            pain, along with swelling, redness, and warmth in that area.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            This problem can arise if your body makes too much uric acid or if
            it doesn't get rid of it properly. Eating certain foods like red
            meat, seafood, alcohol, and sugary drinks can raise uric acid levels
            and trigger these painful gout episodes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            Dealing with gout can be tough as it can really disrupt your daily
            life. Treatment usually involves taking medicines to ease the pain
            and reduce swelling when these painful attacks happen. Making some
            lifestyle changes can also help a lot, such as eating a healthy
            diet, drinking plenty of water, cutting back on alcohol, and keeping
            your weight in check. These steps can not only prevent gout attacks
            but also manage the condition over time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            If you suspect you might have gout or experience sudden joint pain
            and swelling, it's super important to see a doctor. They can figure
            out if it's indeed gout and then suggest the best ways to treat it
            and keep it under control.

    Causes of Gout
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Gout is a type of **inflammatory arthritis** caused by the accumulation of 
      **uric acid crystals in the joints**. It occurs when the body either produces 
      too much uric acid or cannot effectively eliminate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      **High-purine diet** (foods like red meat, shellfish, and organ meats) 
      significantly contributes to uric acid buildup in the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      **Alcohol consumption**, especially beer and spirits, increases uric acid 
      production and reduces its excretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      **Kidney problems** or reduced kidney function impair the removal of uric acid, 
      making individuals more prone to gout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other contributing factors include **obesity, metabolic syndrome, dehydration, 
      certain medications (like diuretics), family history, and high blood pressure**.

      Gout often begins suddenly, usually at night, with **intense joint pain**. 
      The most commonly affected joint is the **big toe**, but it can also affect 
      the ankles, knees, wrists, and elbows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affected joint becomes **red, swollen, warm, and extremely tender**, 
      even a light touch or bedsheet may cause severe discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      **Limited range of motion** occurs in the affected joint due to stiffness and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a severe attack, lingering **discomfort and dull joint pain** may last 
      for several days to weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated gout attacks can cause **chronic joint damage, deformities, and 
      visible uric acid crystal deposits (tophi)** under the skin.
