            <strong>What is Sciatica?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            Sciatica is a pain that shoots down your leg, often starting from
            your lower back or buttocks. It's like a shooting pain or an
            electric shock that can be mild or really painful. This happens
            because of a nerve called the sciatic nerve that runs down your leg.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            The most common reason for sciatica is when a part of your back's
            cushioning discs sticks out and presses on that nerve. This makes
            the nerve inflamed and irritated, causing the shooting pain you
            feel.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            When you have sciatica, you might also feel tingling or numbness in
            your leg or foot, and sometimes your leg might feel weak. Certain
            things like sitting for too long or sudden movements can make the
            pain worse.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            To treat sciatica, you might start with simple things like resting,
            using hot or cold packs on your back, doing gentle stretches, and
            taking over-the-counter pain relievers. Physical therapy can also
            help by making your back and leg muscles stronger and more flexible.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
           If your sciatica is really bad or keeps coming back, it's important to talk to a doctor. Especially if you have other problems like trouble controlling your bladder or bowels or if the pain starts after an injury. A doctor can figure out what's causing your sciatica and suggest the best ways to help you feel better and move around easier. Getting help early can stop things from getting worse and help you recover faster.

    Causes of Sciatica
  </h2>
  <div className=" text-lg space-y-6 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Sciatica occurs when the sciatic nerve, which is the longest and widest nerve in the body, 
      becomes compressed, irritated, or inflamed. This nerve originates in the lower spine and 
      travels through the hips, buttocks, and down each leg. When pressure is applied at any 
      point along its path, it can trigger the classic symptoms of pain, tingling, or weakness 
      that radiates along the leg. The root cause of this nerve disturbance can vary, but it 
      generally involves conditions that affect the spine and surrounding structures. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most common causes is a herniated or slipped disc in the lower back. Discs 
      act as cushions between the vertebrae, and when one becomes damaged or protrudes, 
      it can press directly on the roots of the sciatic nerve. Similarly, spinal stenosis, 
      which is the narrowing of the spinal canal, may restrict the space available for nerves 
      and cause pinching or irritation. Over time, age-related changes like bone spurs or 
      degenerative disc disease can also contribute to nerve compression, making sciatica 
      a frequent problem among older adults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from spinal issues, other factors can also lead to sciatica. Traumatic injuries 
      to the back or pelvis, muscle spasms in the buttocks, or even tumors pressing against 
      the spinal cord may result in irritation of the sciatic nerve. Pregnant women may 
      develop sciatica due to the added weight and postural changes that increase pressure 
      on the lower spine. In addition, poor posture, prolonged sitting, obesity, and a 
      sedentary lifestyle often worsen the condition by placing extra strain on the lower 
      back and supporting muscles. Together, these causes highlight that sciatica is not 
      a single disease, but rather a symptom of underlying problems affecting the spine 
      and nerves.

    Signs and Symptoms of Sciatica
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-6 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The most defining symptom of sciatica is pain that radiates from the lower back into 
      the buttock, thigh, and down the leg, often following the path of the sciatic nerve. 
      This pain can vary in intensity from a dull ache to a sharp, burning sensation or 
      even an electric shock-like jolt. In some people, the pain is continuous, while in 
      others, it comes and goes depending on activity levels or posture. The discomfort 
      is usually felt only on one side of the body, although in rare cases it can affect 
      both legs. Activities such as prolonged sitting, standing, coughing, or sneezing 
      tend to aggravate the pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside pain, many individuals experience tingling, numbness, or a pins-and-needles 
      sensation in the affected leg. This often extends down to the calf or foot and may 
      alternate between areas of numbness and sharp bursts of pain. Some people also 
      notice muscle weakness in the leg or foot, making it difficult to stand, walk, 
      or perform daily tasks with ease. In severe cases, the weakness can cause difficulty 
      lifting the foot (known as "foot drop") or result in a feeling that the leg might 
      suddenly give way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional symptoms may include stiffness in the lower back, reduced mobility, 
      and an inability to maintain certain postures comfortably. While mild sciatica 
      often improves with rest and conservative care, persistent or worsening symptoms 
      may indicate significant nerve compression. In rare but serious situations, sciatica 
      can be accompanied by loss of bladder or bowel control, which requires urgent 
      medical attention. Recognizing these symptoms early and seeking appropriate 
      treatment is crucial to prevent long-term complications and restore mobility.
