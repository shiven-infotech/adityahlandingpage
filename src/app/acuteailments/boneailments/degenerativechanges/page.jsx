            Understanding Degenerative Changes
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Degenerative changes are basically the normal wear and tear our
            bodies go through over time, kind of like how a well-used car might
            show signs of age. Our bones, joints, discs, and other tissues can
            change as we get older.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            These changes might mean our spinal discs thin out or dry up, we
            develop bone spurs, or our joint cartilage wears down. While this is
            all natural, it can lead to issues like osteoarthritis or
            degenerative disc disease, which cause things like pain, stiffness,
            and trouble moving in those areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we can't reverse these changes completely, we can manage them.
            Doing exercises to keep our muscles strong, staying at a healthy
            weight, sitting and standing with good posture, and getting medical
            help if we have ongoing pain or stiffness can all help us keep
            moving well as we grow older.
