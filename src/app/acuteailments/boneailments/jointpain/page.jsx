          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Joint pain is when you feel discomfort or soreness in the places where your bones connect, known as joints. It's pretty common and can range from a mild annoyance to more severe discomfort. This kind of pain can happen in any part of your body where two bones meet.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            There are a bunch of reasons why you might have joint pain. It could be from an injury like a sprain, medical conditions like arthritis, infections, or even from overusing a joint with repetitive motions. When you have joint pain, you might feel pain, stiffness, swelling, warmth, or see redness around the joint.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Keeping a healthy lifestyle can also make a big difference. That means staying active with exercises to keep your joints flexible and strong, eating well, managing your weight, and being careful not to overstrain your joints.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            If your joint pain doesn't go away or gets worse, it's smart to talk to a doctor. They can figure out exactly what's going on, suggest the right treatments to ease your pain, and help you get back to feeling good and moving comfortably.
