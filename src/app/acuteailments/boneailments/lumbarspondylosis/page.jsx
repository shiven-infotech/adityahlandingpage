            <strong>What is Lumbar Spondylosis?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Lumbar spondylosis is a condition that affects your lower back,
            specifically the part of your spine called the lumbar region. It
            happens as you get older and your spinal discs and bones start to
            wear down, causing changes in your spine.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This condition can also be caused by things like having poor
            posture, being overweight, or having had injuries in the past. When
            you have lumbar spondylosis, you might feel pain, stiffness, or
            find it harder to move your lower back. Sometimes, the pain can
            travel down your legs, which is known as sciatica.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            To manage lumbar spondylosis, you can try different things. Pain
            relief options like medications can help with the discomfort. Doing
            physical therapy and specific exercises can make your back muscles
            stronger and improve how well you can move. Changing your lifestyle
            by keeping a healthy weight, sitting and standing properly, and
            using supportive tools can also make a difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to talk to a healthcare provider so they can
            understand your symptoms and create a plan that fits your needs.
            With the right care, people with lumbar spondylosis can feel better
            and keep their spine healthy.
