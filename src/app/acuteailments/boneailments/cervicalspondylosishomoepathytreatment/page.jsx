          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
           Cervical spondylosis, also known as neck arthritis, is a common condition that affects the neck's cervical spine. As we age, the discs and vertebrae in our neck can undergo wear and tear, leading to various symptoms. These can include neck pain, stiffness, headaches, and sometimes tingling or numbness in our arms or hands
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
           This condition can happen due to different reasons, like poor posture, injuries, or even our genes. Over time, this wear and tear can cause bone spurs, herniated discs, or a narrowing of the spinal canal.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Managing cervical spondylosis involves a mix of strategies. Taking pain-relief medications, both over-the-counter and prescribed, can help ease discomfort. Engaging in physical therapy and specific exercises can strengthen neck muscles and boost flexibility. It's also crucial to make lifestyle changes such as keeping a healthy weight, using ergonomic setups at work, and practicing good posture in everyday activities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            By combining these approaches and staying in touch with healthcare providers, we can effectively manage cervical spondylosis and improve our neck health.

    Causes of Cervical Spondylosis
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Cervical spondylosis, also known as cervical osteoarthritis, is a condition
      caused by age-related wear and tear of the bones, discs, and joints in the
      neck (cervical spine). Over time, these changes lead to stiffness, pain,
      and reduced flexibility in the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common cause is **degeneration of intervertebral discs**. With age,
      discs lose their elasticity and height, leading to bone friction and 
      formation of bone spurs (osteophytes).
    </p>
    <p>
      **Poor posture and sedentary lifestyle**—such as prolonged use of computers 
      or mobile phones—can increase pressure on the cervical spine, accelerating 
      degeneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      **Previous neck injuries**, repetitive strain from physical work, or 
      sports-related trauma may also contribute to early onset cervical changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genetic factors, obesity, and lack of regular exercise further raise the 
      risk of developing cervical spondylosis.

    Signs and Symptoms of Cervical Spondylosis
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The most common symptom of cervical spondylosis is **chronic neck pain and stiffness**, 
      which may worsen with movement, prolonged sitting, or looking down at devices. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Many patients experience **headaches that start from the back of the head and 
      radiate forward**, often associated with tightness in the neck and shoulder muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, nerve compression causes **pain radiating to the shoulders, arms, 
      or hands**, along with numbness, tingling, or weakness in the upper limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      **Limited range of motion** in the neck, grinding or popping sounds during movement, 
      and difficulty maintaining posture are also typical signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Severe cases may present with **balance problems, loss of coordination, or 
      difficulty walking**, indicating pressure on the spinal cord (cervical myelopathy).

                Homoeopathy takes a holistic approach to cervical spondylosis treatment.
