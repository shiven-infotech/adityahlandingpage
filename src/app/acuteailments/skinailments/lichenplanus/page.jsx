            <p className="mb-4">
              Lichen Planus is a skin condition that can also affect mucous membranes and nails. It shows up as itchy,
              flat-topped bumps on the skin, often with a purplish color, or as white patches in the mouth. These bumps
              can be uncomfortable and may cause itching or pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the exact cause isn't fully understood, itâ€™s believed to involve an abnormal immune response. Stress,
              medications, or infections might trigger it. Though not contagious or life-threatening, it can be persistent
              and uncomfortable.
