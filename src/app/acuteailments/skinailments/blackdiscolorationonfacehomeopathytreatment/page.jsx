          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Black discoloration on the face refers to those dark spots or patches you might notice on your skin. These spots can vary in size and color, from light brown to almost black. They happen because your skin produces too much melanin, which gives it color. Things like being in the sun a lot, hormonal changes (like during pregnancy or due to certain medicines), skin injuries, inflammation, or even genetics can make these dark patches appear.
            <br /><br />
            It's important to know that this kind of discoloration can happen to anyone, no matter what your skin is like or how old you are. These spots can bother a lot of people and make them feel less confident, so many look for ways to get a more even skin tone.

      Causes of Black Discoloration on the Face
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Black discoloration on the face often results from an overproduction of
      melanin, the natural pigment responsible for skin color. This condition,
      known as hyperpigmentation, can be triggered by several internal and
      external factors that disturb the balance of skin tone.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      One of the most common causes is excessive sun exposure. Ultraviolet (UV)
      rays stimulate melanin production as a defense mechanism, which may leave
      dark patches, particularly on exposed areas like the cheeks, forehead, and
      nose. Hormonal changes, especially during pregnancy or due to conditions
      like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), can also lead to pigmentation
      problems known as melasma.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Skin injuries or inflammations, such as acne, burns, or cuts, may heal
      with dark marks, a condition called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
      Additionally, prolonged use of certain medications, chemical-based
      cosmetics, or lifestyle habits such as smoking can worsen facial
      discoloration over time.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Genetic factors, nutritional deficiencies, and stress may also contribute
      to uneven skin tone. Understanding these underlying causes is important
      for choosing the right treatment and preventing further darkening of the
      skin.

      Signs and Symptoms of Black Discoloration on the Face
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Black discoloration on the face usually appears as dark patches, spots, or
      uneven skin tone. These areas may range in color from light brown to deep
      black, depending on the severity of pigmentation and the underlying cause.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The most noticeable sign is the presence of darker skin on specific parts
      of the face, commonly on the forehead, cheeks, nose, and upper lip. In
      some cases, the discoloration may be patchy, while in others, it may cover
      larger areas of the skin, giving an overall dull or uneven appearance.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      These darkened patches are usually painless but may be accompanied by
      dryness, mild itching, or irritation, especially if linked to acne, skin
      injury, or allergic reactions to cosmetics. Over time, the discoloration
      can become more prominent due to sun exposure or hormonal fluctuations.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Emotional effects are also common, as visible facial discoloration can
      affect self-confidence and social interactions. Recognizing these signs
      early helps in seeking appropriate treatment and preventing further
      worsening of the condition.
