            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Vitiligo is a skin condition where patches of skin lose their color,
              turning white or light. This happens because cells called melanocytes,
              which give skin its color, either stop working or are damaged. While
              Vitiligo isn't harmful, it can affect how someone feels about their appearance.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4">
              It's not something you can catch from someone else, and it can happen
              to anyone, no matter their skin type or age. We're not entirely sure
              why it happens, but it seems to involve genetics, the immune system,
              and environmental factors like stress or sun exposure.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4">
              Treatment for Vitiligo focuses on restoring skin color. Homeopathy is
              a natural approach that considers a person's overall health and uses
              gentle remedies to support the body's healing process. This can help
              improve skin pigmentation over time and boost overall well-being.

      Causes of Vitiligo
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Vitiligo is a skin condition in which patches of skin lose their natural color due 
      to the destruction or malfunction of melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing 
      skin pigment (melanin). While the exact cause of vitiligo is not fully understood, 
      several factors are believed to contribute to its development.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      One major factor is **autoimmunity**, where the bodyâ€™s immune system mistakenly attacks 
      and destroys melanocytes, leading to the loss of skin pigmentation. 
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      **Genetic predisposition** also plays a role, as vitiligo often runs in families and is 
      linked to specific inherited genes that increase susceptibility. 
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Other possible triggers include **environmental factors** such as stress, chemical exposure, 
      skin injuries (known as the Koebner phenomenon), and severe sunburn, which may accelerate 
      the appearance of vitiligo patches. 
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Additionally, vitiligo is sometimes associated with other autoimmune conditions like 
      thyroid disorders, diabetes, or alopecia areata, indicating a deeper link between 
      immune system imbalance and skin pigmentation loss.

      Signs and Symptoms of Vitiligo
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Vitiligo primarily affects the skin by causing a loss of natural pigmentation. 
      The most noticeable symptom is the development of light or white patches that 
      appear on various parts of the body. These patches may spread slowly or rapidly, 
      depending on the individual case.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Common areas where vitiligo patches appear include the **face, hands, arms, legs, lips, 
      and areas around body openings such as the eyes, mouth, and genitals**. The patches are 
      often symmetrical, appearing on both sides of the body.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      In addition to skin depigmentation, vitiligo may cause **premature whitening or graying 
      of scalp hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, or beard**. Some individuals may also notice changes 
      in the color of the inner lining of the mouth and nose (mucous membranes).
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg  leading-relaxed">
      Although vitiligo does not cause physical discomfort like pain or itching in most cases, 
      its visible appearance can affect self-confidence and emotional well-being, making early 
      diagnosis and supportive care important.
