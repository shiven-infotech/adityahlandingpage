            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Vitiligo is a skin condition where patches of skin lose their color,
              turning white or light. This happens because cells called melanocytes,
              which give skin its color, either stop working or are damaged. While
              Vitiligo isn't harmful, it can affect how someone feels about their appearance.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4">
              It's not something you can catch from someone else, and it can happen
              to anyone, no matter their skin type or age. We're not entirely sure
              why it happens, but it seems to involve genetics, the immune system,
              and environmental factors like stress or sun exposure.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4">
              Treatment for Vitiligo focuses on restoring skin color. Homeopathy is
              a natural approach that considers a person's overall health and uses
              gentle remedies to support the body's healing process. This can help
              improve skin pigmentation over time and boost overall well-being.
