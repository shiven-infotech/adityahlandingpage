          <p className="mb-4">
            Acne is a common skin condition caused by a mix of factors like too much oil (sebum) production, pores getting clogged, inflammation, and bacterial growth. Things like hormones, stress, what you eat, and your genes can also affect acne. It can range from occasional pimples to severe breakouts or painful cystic acne that can leave marks.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            To treat acne well, you need to not only deal with existing pimples but also stop new ones and prevent scarring. Homeopathy looks at acne as part of your overall health, considering your skin type, hormones, lifestyle, and emotions. Homeopathic remedies are natural and help your body heal itself without causing harsh side effects.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Alongside homeopathy, having a good skincare routine is crucial. Clean your face gently to remove dirt and extra oil, use products that don't block pores, avoid picking at pimples, and protect your skin from too much sun. Changing your diet, managing stress, and staying active can also support homeopathy in managing acne effectively.
          </p>

            Talking to a qualified homeopathic practitioner can give you personalized advice and treatment plans based on your acne, helping you get clearer, healthier skin and feel more confident.
