          Eczema, or atopic dermatitis, is a skin issue causing red, itchy, and inflamed patches
          that can be dry, scaly, or even ooze at times. It affects people of all ages and tends
          to flare up due to triggers like allergens, irritants, climate changes, stress, or
          hormonal shifts. Managing eczema involves regular moisturizing to prevent dryness and
          itchiness, avoiding triggers, using gentle skincare products, and sometimes medications
          like steroids or antihistamines.

          Homeopathy provides a natural approach to eczema care. It tailors remedies to an
          individual's symptoms and health, aiming not just to relieve symptoms but also to tackle
          the root causes of flare-ups. These treatments are gentle, safe, and can complement
          conventional eczema therapies effectively.
