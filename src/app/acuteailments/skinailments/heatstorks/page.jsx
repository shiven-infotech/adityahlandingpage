            What is Heat Storks?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Heat Storks is when your body feels really hot and causes sweating, crankiness,
            and discomfort. It often happens due to hormonal shifts, like during menopause
            or certain health issues. Imagine feeling like your internal temperature dial is
            stuck on "hot," even on cool days! Dealing with Heat Storks means finding ways
            to cool off and fixing any hormone imbalances. Treatments can range from changing
            your lifestyle to trying herbs or homeopathy, which uses natural methods to help
            your body regulate its heat better.

            Homeopathy Treatment for Heat Storks
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Homeopathy offers a holistic approach, treating the root cause such as hormonal
            imbalances rather than just symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are gentle, natural,
            and tailored to your unique symptoms.
            <br /><br />
            By addressing both physical and emotional factors, homeopathy aims to regulate
            the body’s internal temperature for long-term relief and better well-being.
