          <p>
            Skin rashes are changes in how your skin looks or feels and can
            happen for different reasons. They often look like red, itchy
            patches or bumps and can be caused by allergies, infections, or
            other health problems. Rashes can range from mild to severe, and
            they might appear and disappear quickly or stay for a while. Think
            of them as your skin's way of letting you know that something's not
            quite right, whether it's a reaction to something you touched, an
            infection, or an underlying health issue. Treating rashes usually
            means finding out what caused them and using remedies to calm the
            skin and deal with the main problem.
