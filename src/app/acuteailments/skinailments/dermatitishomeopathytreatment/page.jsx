         <p>
          Dermatitis covers various skin inflammations like eczema, contact dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. These can be caused by allergens such as pollen or certain foods, irritants like harsh soaps, infections, and stress. Symptoms vary from mild redness and itching to more severe blistering. Treatment includes finding and avoiding triggers, using gentle skincare products and moisturizers. Sometimes, medical advice or alternative treatments like homeopathy can help manage it effectively for individual needs. It's important to understand your skin's reactions and seek the right care to keep it healthy and comfortable.

      Causes of Dermatitis
    </h2>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-2">
      Dermatitis refers to inflammation of the skin and can arise from various factors. 
      The exact cause often depends on the type of dermatitis, but in general, it develops 
      when the skin reacts to irritants, allergens, or internal immune responses.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Genetic Factors:</span> 
      A family history of eczema, asthma, or hay fever may increase the risk of developing 
      certain forms of dermatitis, such as atopic dermatitis.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Allergens:</span> 
      Exposure to allergens like pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or certain foods can 
      trigger immune responses that lead to flare-ups.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Irritants:</span> 
      Contact with soaps, detergents, cosmetics, fragrances, and harsh chemicals often 
      causes irritation, leading to contact dermatitis.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Environmental Factors:</span> 
      Changes in weather, extreme heat or cold, and low humidity can dry out the skin 
      and worsen dermatitis symptoms.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Stress:</span> 
      Emotional stress can weaken the skinâ€™s natural barrier and act as a trigger 
      for flare-ups or worsening of existing symptoms.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Immune System Dysfunction:</span> 
      In some cases, the immune system becomes overactive and mistakenly attacks healthy 
      skin, contributing to chronic inflammation.

      Signs and Symptoms of Dermatitis
    </h2>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      Dermatitis affects the skin in different ways depending on its type and severity. 
      While the symptoms may vary from person to person, they generally involve irritation, 
      inflammation, and discomfort.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Redness and Inflammation:</span> 
      The skin often appears red, swollen, or irritated, which can worsen with scratching 
      or exposure to triggers.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Itching:</span> 
      Persistent itching is one of the most common symptoms of dermatitis and can range 
      from mild to severe, sometimes interfering with sleep or daily life.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Dry and Scaly Skin:</span> 
      Affected areas may become rough, flaky, or develop scaly patches, especially when 
      the skin barrier is compromised.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Blisters or Oozing:</span> 
      In some cases, dermatitis can lead to small blisters that may ooze fluid before 
      crusting over.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Thickened Skin:</span> 
      Chronic scratching or rubbing of affected areas can cause the skin to become 
      thick, leathery, or darker in color over time.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Location of Symptoms:</span> 
      Dermatitis often appears on the hands, face, neck, inside of the elbows, behind 
      the knees, or other areas exposed to irritants or allergens.
