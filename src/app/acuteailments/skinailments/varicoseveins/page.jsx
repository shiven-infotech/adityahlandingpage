          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Varicose veins are those bulging, twisted veins that often appear on the legs.
            They happen when the valves inside the veins don’t work properly, causing
            blood to collect and the veins to swell. This can make your legs feel heavy,
            achy, or itchy at times. While varicose veins can be a cosmetic concern,
            they can also bring discomfort or pain, especially after long periods of
            standing or sitting. They're pretty common and usually not a serious health
            issue, but they can be bothersome. Treatments like homeopathy can offer
            relief by managing symptoms and promoting better circulation in the affected veins.
