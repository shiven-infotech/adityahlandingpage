          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Skin rashes are changes in how your skin looks or feels and can happen for different reasons.
            They often look like red, itchy patches or bumps and can be caused by allergies, infections, or other health problems.
            Rashes can range from mild to severe, and they might appear and disappear quickly or stay for a while.
            Think of them as your skin's way of letting you know that something's not quite right, whether it's a reaction to something you touched,
            an infection, or an underlying health issue. Treating rashes usually means finding out what caused them and using remedies
            to calm the skin and deal with the main problem.

    Causes of Skin Rashes
  </h2>
  <div className=" text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Skin rashes can occur due to a wide range of factors, and they often appear
      as red, itchy, or inflamed patches on the skin. One of the most common
      causes is allergic reactions, which may be triggered by certain foods,
      insect bites, medications, or direct contact with substances like soaps,
      detergents, or plants such as poison ivy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infections, whether bacterial, viral, or fungal, are also significant
      contributors to skin rashes. Conditions such as measles, chickenpox, ringworm,
      or impetigo can all present with rashes as a primary symptom. Additionally,
      autoimmune disorders like eczema, psoriasis, and lupus can lead to
      recurrent or chronic rashes that may flare up under stress or environmental
      triggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heat and excessive sweating can result in heat rashes, particularly in hot
      and humid climates. Stress, hormonal imbalances, and certain underlying
      medical conditions can also play a role. Identifying the exact cause is
      essential to managing and treating rashes effectively.

    Signs and Symptoms of Skin Rashes
  </h2>
  <div className=" text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The signs and symptoms of skin rashes vary depending on the underlying
      cause, but most rashes share some common features. The skin often becomes
      red, inflamed, and itchy, causing noticeable discomfort. Some rashes may
      also produce a burning or stinging sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small bumps, blisters, or patches of scaly, dry skin can develop and may
      spread across different areas of the body. In certain cases, the rash may
      ooze fluid, crust over, or cause pain, especially when linked to infections
      or allergic reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In chronic conditions like eczema or psoriasis, rashes may recur frequently
      and cause thickened or cracked skin over time. Other symptoms such as
      swelling, fever, or fatigue may accompany the rash if it is part of a
      systemic condition or infection.
