          <p className="leading-7 text-lg">
            Warts are those tiny bumps or flat spots that pop up on our skin or
            even inside our mouths. They're caused by a virus called HPV, which is
            quite common. Warts can show up anywhere, like on our hands, feet, or
            face, and they come in different shapes and sizes.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-7 text-lg mt-2">
            This virus tricks our skin into growing these little bumps, which can
            be a bit annoying or embarrassing, especially if they're in plain
            sight. Warts are contagious, so you can get them from touching someone
            else's wart or from things like towels or surfaces that have the virus
            on them.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-7 text-lg mt-2">
            Usually, warts vanish on their own after some time, but sometimes they
            stick around and need a little help to go away. That's where homeopathy
            comes inâ€”it gently nudges our body's defenses to fight off the virus
            and shrink those warts. Homeopathic treatments are safe, don't involve
            surgery or anything scary, and are tailored to your specific needs,
            which makes them a great choice for getting rid of warts.

      Causes of Warts
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Warts are caused by an infection of the skin with the Human Papillomavirus
      (HPV). This virus enters the body through tiny cuts, scratches, or
      abrasions in the skin and leads to the overgrowth of cells, forming
      rough, raised skin lesions known as warts.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The virus spreads easily through direct skin-to-skin contact with someone
      who has warts, or indirectly through contaminated surfaces such as towels,
      shoes, or floors in public places like swimming pools and locker rooms.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      A weakened immune system increases the risk of developing warts, as the
      body may not be able to fight off the HPV infection effectively. This is
      why children, teenagers, and individuals with reduced immunity are more
      prone to them.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Excessive moisture and frequent trauma to the skin, such as nail biting,
      shaving, or walking barefoot in public areas, can also contribute to the
      spread and recurrence of warts.

      Signs and Symptoms of Warts
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Warts usually appear as small, rough, raised growths on the skin that may
      vary in size and shape. They are generally painless but can sometimes
      cause discomfort depending on their location.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Common warts often appear on the hands, fingers, or around the nails, while 
      plantar warts grow on the soles of the feet and may cause pain when walking 
      or standing. Flat warts are smoother and smaller, usually found on the face, 
      neck, or legs.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Warts may have a rough surface with black dots inside them, which are tiny, 
      clotted blood vessels. They can appear singly or in clusters, sometimes 
      spreading to other parts of the body.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg leading-relaxed">
      In some cases, warts may itch, become irritated, or bleed if scratched or 
      subjected to friction. While they are generally harmless, their appearance 
      can cause cosmetic concern and discomfort.
