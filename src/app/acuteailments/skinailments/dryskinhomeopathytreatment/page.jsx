          <p>
            Dry skin can really bother you, making your skin feel tight, itchy, or flaky.
            It's not just about the surface; it can signal an imbalance in your skin's natural moisture levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several things can make your skin dry, like dry air, taking hot showers often,
            using harsh soaps, getting older, or even having conditions like eczema or psoriasis.
            Lifestyle choices matter too, such as smoking, too much sun exposure, and not drinking enough water.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, dry skin needs more than just creams. Homeopathy is a gentle way to treat dry skin.
            It looks at your skin type, health, and habits to create a plan just for you.
            Homeopathic remedies target the root cause and aim for long-term skin health.
