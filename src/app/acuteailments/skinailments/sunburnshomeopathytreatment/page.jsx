            What is Sun Burns?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sunburns happen when your skin gets too much sun, especially the kind that can hurt you called ultraviolet (UV) rays. This can make your skin turn red, hurt, and sometimes even bubble or peel if it's really bad. It's like getting a burn from the sun, ranging from a little to a lot! Sunburns aren't just about feeling uncomfortable; they can also raise your chances of getting skin cancer later on. To avoid this, it's important to use sunscreen, wear protective clothes, and stay in the shade when the sun is strong. If you do get a sunburn, using things like aloe vera can help calm it down, or you can talk to a doctor if it's serious.
