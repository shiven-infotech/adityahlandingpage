            What is Alopecia Areata?
          </h1>
          <p className=" text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Alopecia Areata is when your immune system mistakenly attacks hair
            follicles, causing hair loss in small, round patches on your scalp
            or body. It can happen to anyone, regardless of age or gender. We're
            not entirely sure why it occurs, but it could be due to genetics,
            immune system issues, or environmental factors.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4  text-lg leading-relaxed">
            It's not something contagious or a serious health problem, but it
            can be tough for those going through it. Hair often grows back
            within a year, but some might have ongoing issues. Homeopathy and
            other treatments aim to help your immune system get back in balance
            and support natural hair regrowth.

      Causes of Alopecia Areata
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Alopecia Areata is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune
      system mistakenly attacks healthy hair follicles, leading to hair loss.
      The exact cause is not fully understood, but it is believed to be the
      result of a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological
      factors.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Genetics play an important role, as individuals with a family history of
      autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disorders, vitiligo, or type 1
      diabetes are more likely to develop Alopecia Areata. Stress, both physical
      and emotional, is also known to act as a trigger, worsening the condition
      in those who are predisposed.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Environmental factors such as infections, sudden illness, or even certain
      medications may disrupt the immune balance, causing the body to target the
      hair follicles. This results in patchy hair loss that can sometimes spread
      to larger areas of the scalp or body.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      While the direct cause may differ from person to person, the underlying
      mechanism always involves the immune system mistakenly identifying hair
      follicles as harmful and attacking them, leading to hair thinning or bald
      patches.

      Signs and Symptoms of Alopecia Areata
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Alopecia Areata often begins suddenly with small, round bald patches on
      the scalp. These patches may appear smooth and without signs of
      inflammation, making the condition distinct from other types of hair loss.
      In some cases, multiple patches can develop and may merge to form larger
      bald areas.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Hair around the bald patches may become short, broken, or thinner,
      sometimes described as “exclamation mark hairs” because they are narrower
      at the base. This is considered one of the typical features of the
      condition.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Although the scalp is the most common site, Alopecia Areata can also cause
      hair loss on the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and other parts of the body.
      In rare cases, it may progress to complete scalp hair loss
      (Alopecia Totalis) or even total body hair loss (Alopecia Universalis).
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Apart from visible hair loss, individuals may also notice changes in their
      nails, such as pitting, ridging, or roughness. Emotional stress and loss
      of confidence often accompany the physical symptoms, making Alopecia
      Areata a condition that affects both appearance and mental well-being.
