          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
           Cracks on heels, also known as heel fissures, are those pesky splits or openings that form on the skin of our heels. They often pop up because our heels get dry or from standing or walking too much, especially in open-back shoes. These cracks can vary from minor little lines to deep gaps that might hurt or even bleed. Things like living in a dry area, not keeping our feet moisturized, or certain health issues can make them worse. These cracks aren't just about looksâ€”they can make our heels feel sore, cause pain, and if we don't treat them, they might even lead to infections.

      Causes of Cracked Heels
    </h2>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      Cracked heels, also known as heel fissures, occur when the skin around the heels 
      becomes dry, thickened, and loses its elasticity. This condition is not only 
      uncomfortable but can sometimes lead to pain and infection if left untreated. 
      Several underlying factors contribute to the development of cracked heels.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Dry Skin:</span> 
      Lack of moisture is the most common cause. When the skin around the heels becomes 
      excessively dry, it loses flexibility and begins to crack.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Prolonged Standing:</span> 
      Spending long hours standing, especially on hard floors, puts constant pressure on 
      the heels, which can cause the skin to split.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Improper Footwear:</span> 
      Wearing open-back sandals, shoes without proper cushioning, or ill-fitted footwear 
      increases the chances of heel dryness and cracking.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Medical Conditions:</span> 
      Conditions like diabetes, obesity, thyroid disorders, eczema, and psoriasis can 
      contribute to skin changes that make the heels more prone to fissures.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Aging:</span> 
      With age, the skin naturally loses elasticity and thickness, making older adults 
      more susceptible to cracked heels.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Environmental Factors:</span> 
      Exposure to cold weather, low humidity, or walking barefoot on rough surfaces can 
      also dry out the skin and cause cracks to form.

      Signs and Symptoms of Cracked Heels
    </h2>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      Cracked heels usually begin with dry, rough skin and may gradually progress 
      into painful fissures if left untreated. Recognizing the early signs and 
      symptoms helps in preventing complications and ensures timely care. 
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Dry and Flaky Skin:</span> 
      The skin around the heels often appears rough, scaly, and loses its smooth texture.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Thickened Skin:</span> 
      A noticeable buildup of hard, callused skin may form, especially at the edges 
      of the heel.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Visible Cracks:</span> 
      Small superficial cracks may appear initially, which can deepen over time, 
      leading to painful fissures.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Redness and Itching:</span> 
      The surrounding skin can become irritated, itchy, and inflamed, especially 
      when exposed to friction or dryness.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg mb-4">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Pain or Discomfort:</span> 
      Walking or standing for long periods may become uncomfortable, particularly 
      when the cracks deepen.
    </p>
    <p className=" text-lg">
      <span className="font-semibold text-green-700">Bleeding and Infection:</span> 
      In severe cases, the cracks may bleed or get infected, leading to swelling, 
      pus formation, and significant pain that requires medical attention.
