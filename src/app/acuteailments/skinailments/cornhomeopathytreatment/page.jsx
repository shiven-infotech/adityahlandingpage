          <p className="leading-7 text-lg mb-2">
            Corns are like tiny tough patches that can pop up on your feet or hands
            when they face a lot of rubbing or pressure. They might feel like a small
            bump or a hardened spot and can sometimes hurt, especially when you're
            walking or using your hands a lot.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-7 text-lg mb-2">
            They usually show up in areas that get a lot of action, like your feet
            when you wear tight shoes or your hands when you grip things tightly.
            While they're not usually a big problem, they can be annoying, especially
            if they press on sensitive spots or keep rubbing.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-7 text-lg">
            To deal with corns, it's good to wear comfy shoes, maybe use some soft
            pads or cushions for protection, and keep your feet clean and cozy.
            Homeopathy has some natural tricks up its sleeve too, which can ease the
            pain, reduce any swelling, and stop corns from coming back by taking care
            of what's causing them in the first place.

      Causes of Corn
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Corns develop as a protective response of the skin to repeated friction, 
      pressure, or irritation. When the skin is subjected to continuous stress, 
      it thickens and hardens in the affected area, leading to the formation of corns.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Wearing tight, ill-fitting, or narrow shoes is one of the most common causes 
      of corns, as it increases friction against the toes and feet. High-heeled 
      shoes can also contribute by putting extra pressure on certain areas of the foot.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Walking or standing for long periods, especially on hard surfaces, can put 
      extra stress on the feet, encouraging corn formation. Similarly, repetitive 
      activities like running, sports, or even improper walking posture can lead to 
      skin thickening.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Other contributing factors include foot deformities such as hammertoes, bunions, 
      or abnormal gait, which increase localized pressure points and make corns more 
      likely to form.

      Signs and Symptoms of Corn
    </h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Corns usually appear as small, thickened, and hardened areas of skin that develop 
      on the feet or toes. They are often round in shape and may feel rough or dry 
      to the touch. Corns are generally smaller than calluses and are more localized.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Pain or tenderness when walking, wearing shoes, or pressing on the affected 
      area is one of the most common symptoms. This discomfort is usually caused 
      by the corn pressing against underlying tissues.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Corns may appear yellowish, grayish, or whitish in color, often surrounded 
      by inflamed skin. In some cases, they can become red and irritated if friction 
      or pressure continues.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      In severe cases, corns may cause difficulty walking or wearing certain footwear, 
      especially if they grow larger or become infected due to continuous irritation.

                  Homoeopathy can effectively treat corns by addressing the underlying

                  proper foot care, corns can be significantly reduced or eliminated.
