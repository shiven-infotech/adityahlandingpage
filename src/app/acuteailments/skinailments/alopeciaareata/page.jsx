            Alopecia Areata Homeopathy Treatment?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            Alopecia Areata is when your immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles, causing hair loss in small, round patches on your scalp or body. It can happen to anyone, regardless of age or gender. We're not entirely sure why it occurs, but it could be due to genetics, immune system issues, or environmental factors.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 text-lg">
            It's not contagious or a serious health problem, but it can be emotionally difficult. Hair often grows back within a year, but some people may experience longer-term hair loss. Homeopathy aims to support immune balance and encourage natural hair regrowth.
