          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Vision improvement is all about making our eyesight better, so we can see
            more clearly and comfortably. It includes things like making sure our
            focus is sharp, we can judge distances well, we see colors accurately,
            and our overall vision is sharp.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            Our vision can change due to different reasons like getting older, having
            issues like nearsightedness or farsightedness, straining our eyes, or
            having other health problems. To improve our vision, we can do things
            like changing our lifestyle, doing exercises for our eyes, eating better,
            and trying alternative treatments like homeopathy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            Homeopathy is a natural way to improve vision because it looks at our
            whole health, including our eyes and how we live. It helps strengthen
            our eye muscles, promotes good eye health, and deals with the root causes
            affecting our vision. This way, we can make lasting improvements to our
            eyesight without relying too much on glasses or surgery.
