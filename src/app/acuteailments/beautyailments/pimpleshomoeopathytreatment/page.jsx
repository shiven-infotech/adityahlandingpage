          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Pimples aren't just caused by things like oil and bacteriaâ€”they can
            also pop up because of daily habits like what we eat, how we sleep,
            and how stressed we are. Hormonal changes, especially during big
            life events like puberty or pregnancy, can also cause our skin to
            get oilier, leading to more pimples.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Taking care of pimples means doing things like washing our face
            regularly with gentle products, avoiding rough treatments, and not
            touching our face too much to keep bacteria away. Homeopathy looks
            at everything that might be causing pimples, like our skin type,
            hormones, and overall health, to give us treatments that are just
            right for us. These treatments help calm down redness, keep oil in
            check, and support our skin's natural health, so we can say bye-bye
            to pimples the natural way!

    Causes of Pimples
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Pimples, also known as acne, occur when the skinâ€™s hair follicles become
      clogged with excess oil (sebum), dead skin cells, and sometimes bacteria.
      This blockage leads to inflammation and the formation of red, swollen
      bumps on the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hormonal changes are a major cause of pimples, especially during puberty,
      menstruation, pregnancy, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS). These hormonal fluctuations increase oil production in the skin,
      making breakouts more likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor skincare habits, such as irregular cleansing, using harsh products,
      or sleeping with makeup on, can worsen pimples. Diets high in sugary or
      oily foods, stress, and lack of sleep may also trigger or aggravate acne.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, genetics and family history play a role in the likelihood
      of developing pimples. Environmental factors like pollution and humidity
      can further irritate the skin and contribute to breakouts.

    Signs and Symptoms of Pimples
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    <p>
      Pimples usually appear as small, raised red bumps on the skin, often
      accompanied by tenderness or mild pain. They commonly develop on the face,
      forehead, chest, back, and shoulders where oil glands are most active.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many cases, pimples may be filled with pus, forming whiteheads or
      yellowish spots. Blackheads, which are open pores clogged with oil and
      dead skin cells, are another common sign of acne.
    </p>
    <p>
      More severe cases may involve painful, deep lumps or cysts under the skin,
      which can cause swelling and discomfort. These forms of pimples take
      longer to heal and may leave scars if untreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pimples are often associated with oily skin, enlarged pores, and sometimes
      increased skin sensitivity. Recurrent breakouts, especially around
      hormonal changes, are also a key symptom of acne.
