            What is Dark Circles Under Eyes?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Dark circles under the eyes are those annoying shadows or
            discolorations that show up below our lower eyelids, making us look
            tired or older. They can come from various things like genes, not
            getting enough sleep, feeling stressed, having allergies, or
            rubbing our eyes too much.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The skin around our eyes is super delicate and thinner than the
            rest of our face, which is why these circles stand out more.
            Sometimes, it's because tiny blood vessels show through the skin,
            making it look dark. Changes in skin color or not drinking enough
            water can also make them worse.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            To deal with dark circles, it's good to sleep well, manage stress,
            keep hydrated, use creams made for under the eyes, and handle any
            allergies. Homeopathy is a natural way to treat them, focusing on
            your unique needs to get rid of those pesky circles gently and
            effectively.

              can reduce those dark patches and puffiness.

    Causes of Dark Circles
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Dark circles under the eyes are a common cosmetic concern and can occur
      due to a variety of factors. One of the most common causes is fatigue or
      lack of sleep, which can make the skin appear paler and allow blood
      vessels beneath the skin to become more visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genetics also play a significant role. Some individuals inherit thinner
      under-eye skin or a tendency to hyperpigmentation, which makes dark circles
      more prominent. Age-related changes, such as loss of collagen and fat, can
      further accentuate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifestyle factors, including excessive sun exposure, smoking, alcohol
      consumption, and stress, can contribute to dark circles. Allergies and
      sinus congestion can also cause swelling and discoloration in the under-eye
      area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nutritional deficiencies, particularly of iron or vitamins, may worsen the
      appearance of dark circles. Identifying the underlying cause is key to
      managing and reducing their visibility effectively.

   {/* Signs and Symptoms of Dark Circles */}
<section className=" mt-8">
  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-4">
    Signs and Symptoms of Dark Circles
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The most obvious sign of dark circles is a noticeable discoloration under
      the eyes, which can appear bluish, purple, brown, or dark gray. This
      discoloration is usually more visible when the surrounding skin is lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark circles may be accompanied by puffiness, swelling, or mild
      hollowness under the eyes, which can make the area look tired or aged.
      Some people also notice fine lines or wrinkles in the under-eye region
      along with the discoloration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severity of dark circles may fluctuate throughout the day or worsen
      with fatigue, stress, or dehydration. They can be symmetrical or more
      prominent under one eye depending on genetics, lifestyle, or underlying
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      While dark circles themselves are usually harmless, sudden changes in
      color, swelling, or texture may indicate an underlying health issue and
      should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.
