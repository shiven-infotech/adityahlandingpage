          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is a common eye problem that causes
            redness and swelling in the clear tissue covering the white part of your eye and
            lining the inner eyelids (called the conjunctiva). It can happen because of
            infections, allergies, irritants like smoke or chemicals, or viruses like those
            causing the common cold.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            When you have conjunctivitis, your eyes may look red or pink, feel itchy or
            gritty, produce a watery or thick discharge, and sometimes cause blurry vision.
            It can affect one or both eyes and can spread easily, especially if it's due to
            bacteria or viruses.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
           Treating conjunctivitis depends on what caused it. Homoeopathy offers a natural way to deal with this condition using gentle remedies customized to your specific symptoms and overall health. These remedies are designed to ease inflammation, relieve discomfort, and help your eyes heal without causing any harsh side effects. That's why many people find homeopathy a great choice for managing conjunctivitis.

    Causes of Conjunctivitis
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Conjunctivitis, commonly known as ‚Äúpink eye,‚Äù occurs when the conjunctiva
      ‚Äî the thin, transparent tissue covering the white part of the eye and the
      inner surface of the eyelids ‚Äî becomes inflamed. This inflammation may be
      caused by infections, allergies, or irritants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viral infections are the most common cause, often linked to the same
      viruses that cause colds and respiratory illnesses. Bacterial infections,
      such as those caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus, can also trigger
      conjunctivitis and are more likely to produce discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allergic conjunctivitis develops when the eyes react to allergens like
      pollen, dust mites, animal dander, or mold. Chemical irritants such as
      chlorine in swimming pools, smoke, or exposure to pollutants may also
      cause conjunctival inflammation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, contact lens overuse, poor hygiene, or exposure to foreign
      objects in the eye can lead to conjunctivitis. Newborns may develop it due
      to blocked tear ducts or infections acquired during birth.

    Signs and Symptoms of Conjunctivitis
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The hallmark symptom of conjunctivitis is redness in the white part of the
      eye, giving it a ‚Äúpink‚Äù or bloodshot appearance. This is often accompanied
      by irritation, burning, or a gritty sensation, as if something is stuck in
      the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excessive tearing or watery eyes are common, especially in viral and
      allergic conjunctivitis. In bacterial cases, a thick yellow or green
      discharge may be present, sometimes causing the eyelids to stick together
      after sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swelling of the eyelids, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and blurred
      vision can also occur. Itching is a particularly strong feature of
      allergic conjunctivitis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conjunctivitis often affects both eyes, though it may start in one and
      spread to the other. In children, restlessness, rubbing of the eyes, and
      reluctance to go to bright places are frequent indicators.
