          <p className="text-lg leading-7">
            Premature greying of hair can happen due to various reasons like family traits,
            stress, lifestyle habits, and not getting enough nutrients. Genes are a big part of itâ€”they
            decide when your hair starts losing color. Stress can speed up this process, as can
            things like smoking or not eating well. Some health conditions and treatments can also
            make your hair turn grey sooner. While it's normal as you age, early greying can affect
            how you feel about yourself. Homeopathy offers personalized treatments to tackle these
            causes and promote healthy hair growth, helping you manage premature greying effectively.

        <strong className="text-green-700">Holistic Approach:</strong> Homeopathy looks at the whole picture. It doesn't just focus on the grey hair itself but considers things like stress, diet, and family history to understand why it's happening.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong className="text-green-700">Individualized Treatment:</strong> Think of it like a tailor-made plan. Homeopathy doesn't treat everyone the same way because what works for one person might not work for another. So, your treatment is unique to your specific reasons for greying hair.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong className="text-green-700">Safe and Natural:</strong> Homeopathic remedies come from natural sources like plants and minerals. This means they're gentle on your body and don't come with the harsh side effects that some other treatments might have.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong className="text-green-700">Promotes Hair Health:</strong> Instead of just covering up the grey, homeopathy aims to improve your hair's overall health. By addressing things like nutrition and stress, it helps your hair stay healthy and may even restore some of its natural color over time.

    Causes of Greying of Hair
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Greying of hair is a natural part of the aging process and occurs when the
      hair follicles produce less melanin, the pigment responsible for giving
      hair its color. As melanin production slows down, hair gradually turns
      grey or white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genetics play a major role in determining when a person begins to develop
      grey hair. If early greying runs in the family, it is more likely to occur
      at a younger age. Along with heredity, certain health conditions such as
      vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid disorders, and autoimmune diseases can
      contribute to premature greying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifestyle factors like chronic stress, poor diet, smoking, and exposure to
      environmental pollutants can accelerate the greying process. Free radical
      damage caused by oxidative stress weakens the pigment-producing cells in
      the hair follicles, leading to loss of color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequent use of harsh hair dyes, chemical treatments, and heat styling may
      also damage hair and contribute to premature greying. Identifying whether
      the cause is genetic, nutritional, or lifestyle-related is important in
      managing or slowing down the process.

    Signs and Symptoms of Greying of Hair
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed mb-8">
    <p>
      The most obvious sign of greying hair is the gradual appearance of strands
      that turn grey, silver, or white. This usually starts at the temples and
      crown before spreading across the scalp over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cases of premature greying, younger individuals may notice isolated
      grey hairs appearing earlier than expected, often in their twenties or
      thirties. The process usually begins slowly but may accelerate depending
      on genetics, health, and lifestyle factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with color changes, some people experience changes in hair texture.
      Grey hair often feels coarser, drier, and more brittle compared to natural
      pigmented hair, which can make it prone to breakage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain cases, greying may be accompanied by thinning hair or hair
      fall, especially when related to nutritional deficiencies or underlying
      medical conditions. These combined changes can affect both appearance and
      confidence.
