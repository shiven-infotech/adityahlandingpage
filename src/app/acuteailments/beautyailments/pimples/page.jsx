          <p className="mb-4">
            Pimples aren't just caused by things like oil and bacteriaâ€”they can
            also pop up because of daily habits like what we eat, how we sleep,
            and how stressed we are. Hormonal changes, especially during big
            life events like puberty or pregnancy, can also cause our skin to
            get oilier, leading to more pimples.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking care of pimples means doing things like washing our face
            regularly with gentle products, avoiding rough treatments, and not
            touching our face too much to keep bacteria away. Homeopathy looks
            at everything that might be causing pimples, like our skin type,
            hormones, and overall health, to give us treatments that are just
            right for us. These treatments help calm down redness, keep oil in
            check, and support our skin's natural health, so we can say bye-bye
            to pimples the natural way!
