          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Dandruff is something most of us have dealt withâ€”it's those pesky
            white or yellowish flakes that appear in our hair and on our
            shoulders. These flakes are just dead skin cells from our scalp.
            While dandruff isn't harmful, it can be annoying, itchy, and
            embarrassing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Several factors can cause dandruff, like having dry or oily skin,
            being sensitive to certain hair products, or having a fungus called
            <strong> Malassezia</strong> on our scalp. When these factors are off
            balance, they cause more skin cells to grow, leading to dandruff.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
To manage dandruff, special shampoos and treatments target these root causesâ€”like controlling oiliness, keeping your scalp moisturized, or fighting fungal growth. Plus, keeping your scalp clean and healthy helps prevent dandruff from coming back.

    Causes of Dandruff
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Dandruff is a common scalp condition characterized by flaking, itching, and
      irritation. One of the primary causes is a yeast-like fungus called
      Malassezia, which feeds on oils produced by the scalp. Overgrowth of this
      fungus can accelerate skin cell turnover, leading to visible flakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dry scalp is another major contributor, as lack of moisture can cause skin
      to become flaky and itchy. Environmental factors such as cold weather,
      low humidity, and harsh shampoos can worsen dryness and trigger dandruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seborrheic dermatitis, a skin condition causing red, greasy, and flaky
      patches, is closely linked to dandruff. Other factors include hormonal
      changes, stress, poor diet, and sensitivity to hair care products.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, underlying medical conditions such as psoriasis or eczema
      can also manifest as dandruff-like flakes. Identifying the root cause is
      essential for effective management and treatment of the condition.

    Signs and Symptoms of Dandruff
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg mb-6 space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The most noticeable symptom of dandruff is the presence of white or yellow
      flakes on the scalp and in the hair. These flakes may be visible on clothing,
      particularly on dark-colored shirts, and can be accompanied by mild to
      intense itching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redness or irritation of the scalp often occurs alongside flaking, especially
      in cases of seborrheic dermatitis. Some people may experience a greasy or
      oily scalp, which can make the flakes stick together in larger clumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persistent scratching due to itching can sometimes lead to small sores or
      infections on the scalp. In chronic cases, dandruff may be associated with
      discomfort, embarrassment, or self-consciousness due to its visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dandruff can vary in severity, from mild flaking to extensive scalp irritation,
      and may come and go depending on environmental factors, stress, and scalp
      care routines.
