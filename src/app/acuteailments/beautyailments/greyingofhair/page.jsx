          <p className="text-lg leading-7">
            Premature greying of hair can happen due to various reasons like family traits,
            stress, lifestyle habits, and not getting enough nutrients. Genes are a big part of itâ€”they
            decide when your hair starts losing color. Stress can speed up this process, as can
            things like smoking or not eating well. Some health conditions and treatments can also
            make your hair turn grey sooner. While it's normal as you age, early greying can affect
            how you feel about yourself. Homeopathy offers personalized treatments to tackle these
            causes and promote healthy hair growth, helping you manage premature greying effectively.
