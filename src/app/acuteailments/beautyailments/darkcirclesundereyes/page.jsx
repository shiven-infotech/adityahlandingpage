            What is Dark Circles Under Eyes?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Dark circles under the eyes are those annoying shadows or
            discolorations that show up below our lower eyelids, making us look
            tired or older. They can come from various things like genes, not
            getting enough sleep, feeling stressed, having allergies, or
            rubbing our eyes too much.
          </p>
          <p>
            The skin around our eyes is super delicate and thinner than the
            rest of our face, which is why these circles stand out more.
            Sometimes, it's because tiny blood vessels show through the skin,
            making it look dark. Changes in skin color or not drinking enough
            water can also make them worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            To deal with dark circles, it's good to sleep well, manage stress,
            keep hydrated, use creams made for under the eyes, and handle any
            allergies. Homeopathy is a natural way to treat them, focusing on
            your unique needs to get rid of those pesky circles gently and
            effectively.

            How Homeopathy Treatment Can Be a Good Option for Dark Circles Under Eyes?
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Holistic Approach:</strong> Homeopathy looks at your specific
              situation—like how well you sleep, how stressed you feel, and
              your overall health—to figure out why you have dark circles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Natural Remedies:</strong> Homeopathic treatments use natural
              substances that are safe for your skin. They won’t cause any
              harsh reactions, unlike some other treatments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Better Circulation:</strong> Homeopathy tries to boost the
              blood flow around your eyes. When your blood circulates well, it
              can reduce those dark patches and puffiness.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-Lasting Results:</strong> Instead of just hiding the
              problem temporarily, homeopathy works on fixing what's causing
              your dark circles.
