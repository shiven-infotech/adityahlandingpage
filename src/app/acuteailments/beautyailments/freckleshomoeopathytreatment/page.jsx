          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Freckles are those charming little spots that often grace our skin, especially after soaking up some sunshine. They add a touch of whimsy to our faces! These spots are caused by melanin, the pigment that gives our skin its color. When we're exposed to sunlight, our skin produces more melanin to shield itself, resulting in these lovely freckles.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            They're generally harmless, varying in size and darkness. Some cherish their freckles as a unique part of their appearance, while others may wish to lighten or diminish them. Freckles are most noticeable on fair skin but can appear on any skin tone.

    Causes of Freckles
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      Freckles are small, flat, brownish spots on the skin that usually appear
      on areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, arms, and shoulders. They
      develop when the skin produces excess melanin, the pigment responsible for
      skin color, in response to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genetics play a major role in the development of freckles. Individuals with
      fair skin and a family history of freckles are more likely to develop them,
      especially after sun exposure. The presence of the MC1R gene variant is
      closely associated with freckle formation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sun exposure is a key environmental factor. Frequent or intense exposure to
      UV rays stimulates melanocytes in the skin to produce more pigment, making
      freckles more noticeable and potentially increasing their number over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hormonal changes, certain medications, and skin trauma can also contribute
      to the appearance or darkening of freckles. Unlike moles, freckles are
      generally harmless but may become more pronounced with prolonged sun
      exposure.

    Signs and Symptoms of Freckles
  </h2>
  <div className="text-lg space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
    <p>
      The most noticeable sign of freckles is the appearance of small, flat,
      light brown to dark brown spots on the skin. They usually range in size
      from a few millimeters to a centimeter and are more visible on sun-exposed
      areas like the face, shoulders, arms, and upper back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freckles are generally uniform in color and shape, and they tend to become
      darker or more pronounced after exposure to sunlight. In contrast to moles,
      they do not protrude from the skin and do not usually change significantly
      over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freckles may appear in clusters or be scattered, and their number can
      increase with repeated sun exposure. They are most common in individuals
      with fair skin and light-colored hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freckles are harmless and typically do not cause pain, itching, or other
      symptoms. However, sudden changes in color, size, or shape should be
      evaluated by a dermatologist to rule out other skin conditions.
